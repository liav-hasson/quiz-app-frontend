# React scaffold for Quiz App frontend

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold so you can start implementing the new frontend.

How to run locally:

1. cd frontend/react-app
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The existing Python-based frontend (templates/static) is preserved in `frontend/`; no files were removed. Integrate the React UI with the backend API when ready.
